# boiler plate
generic data pipeline

As of 2022-09-12, this is a work in progress, but may be viewed as an incomplete sample of how I code this sort of thing. (At times, it will also include techniques I'm learning, refreshing myself on, or experimenting with further.)

As this becomes more mature, I intend to make greater use of a branch -> develop -> merge git workflow.

Currently, branch(es) are related to recruitment-related data exercises and my prep. for them.
